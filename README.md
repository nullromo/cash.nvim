# üí∏ Cash.nvim

**CASH**: **C**hoose from **A**vailable **S**earch **H**ighlights

## üí∞ Overview

This plugin adds additional search registers to Neovim. Normally when you
perform a search in (Neo-)Vim, your previous search is overwritten. Cash.nvim
provides you with 9 "cash registers" (haha) that you can use to store multiple
searches at once. Highlighting and jump functionality is handled separately for
each cash register.

## üí≥ TL;DR / Quick Start

Use <kbd>?</kbd>`<number>` (1-9) to select a cash register. This gives you 9
individual searches that can be highlighted simultaneously.

## üí≤ How to Install

Lazy.nvim config:

```lua
{
    'nullromo/cash.nvim',
    opts = {}, -- specify options here
    config = function(_, opts)
        local cash = require('cash')
        cash.setup(opts)
    end,
}
```

## üí∂ Compatibility Issues / Warnings

Cash.nvim will overwrite the default behavior of the <kbd>?</kbd> key.

## üíµ How to Use

### Search Normally

With Cash.nvim, you can perform searches normally, and they will show up
normally. Start a search with <kbd>/</kbd>, <kbd>\*</kbd>, or <kbd>#</kbd> (but
not <kbd>?</kbd>; see below) from normal mode, then use <kbd>n</kbd> and
<kbd>N</kbd> to navigate through the highlighted matches.

### Select Cash Register

By default, your working cash register is cash register 1. Every time you
search, the contents of cash register 1 will update to match your search terms.
You will jump between instances of the search term stored in cash register 1.

To switch to a different cash register, press <kbd>?</kbd> followed by a single
digit. This will change the working cash register to the specified number. For
example, use <kbd>?</kbd><kbd>2</kbd> to switch to cash register 2.

Once you change cash registers, the search highlighting of the old cash
register will remain on the screen. You can then perform a new search
independent of the previous one. Any search you perform will always overwrite
the contents of the working cash register.

Jumping always jumps between occurrences that match the contents of the working
cash register, skipping over matches for other cash registers. If you want to
jump between matches for a different cash register other than the working one,
simply switch back to that cash register and start jumping.

### Clear Cash Registers

To clear the contents of the working cash register, use `:clc`. This will also
set Vim's search to an empty string.

To clear all cash registers and reset the plugin to its initial state, use the
`:ResetCashRegisters` user command (or the
`require('cash').resetCashRegisters()` function). This will set Vim's search
register to an empty string and clear the contents of all cash registers.

## üí± Customization

### Default Options

```lua
{
    -- center the screen after each search
    centerAfterSearch = true,
    -- color settings
    colors = {
        -- default colors for foreground and background (used for highlight
        -- groups where fg/bg are not specified)
        defaultBG = constants.colors.roninYellow,
        defaultFG = constants.colors.sumiInk0,
        -- define colors for highlight groups 1-9
        highlightColors = {
            { bg = constants.colors.roninYellow },
            { bg = constants.colors.springBlue },
            { bg = constants.colors.sakuraPink },
            { bg = constants.colors.springGreen },
            { bg = constants.colors.autumnYellow },
            { bg = constants.colors.oniViolet },
            { bg = constants.colors.autumnGreen },
            { bg = constants.colors.autumnRed },
            { bg = constants.colors.waveBlue2, fg = constants.colors.fujiWhite },
        },
    },
    -- setting to control whether or not using * or # from normal mode will
    -- jump to the next occurrence. Vim will jump by default
    disableStarPoundJump = true,
    -- force disable Vim's hlsearch option
    respectHLSearch = false,
}
```

### `centerAfterSearch`

Each time you perform a search, Cash.nvim will center the current window for
you. If you don't like this behavior, you can disable it by setting this option
to `false`.

### `colors`

This table controls the highlight colors for Cash.nvim.

#### `defaultBG` and `defaultFG`

These will be the highlight background and foreground, respectively for
highlight colors that do not have a `bg` or `fg` color specified, respectively.

#### `highlightColors`

This is a table of 9 values, each with a `bg` and `fg` field. These define the
highlight colors for each of the 9 available cash registers. If a `bg` or `fg`
value is not specified in one of these entries, then the
`defaultBG`/`defaultFG` color will be used.

Colors should be of the form `'#RRGGBB'`.

### `disableStarPoundJump`

By default, Vim will jump you to the next occurrence of a search term if you
initiate the search using <kbd>\*</kbd> or <kbd>#</kbd>. Cash.nvim disables
this by default. You can preserve Vim's default behavior by setting this option
to `false`.

### `respectHLSearch`

In order to enable search highlighting for the current search, you need to
enable the `hlsearch` Vim option. Cash.nvim does this automatically, but if you
want your `hlsearch` setting to be left as-is, then you can set this option to
`true`.

## ü§ë TODO List

- Make current number and current color display next to clock.
- Create better debug function other than current `<Leader>v`.
- Debug case sensitivity and try to respect `smartcase` and `ignorecase`.
  Right now, searching for `asdf` in cash register 1 will match `Asdf`,
  `ASDF`, etc, but then switching to cash register 2 will make the
  `matchadd()` require an exact case match.
- Add `?+` and `?-` (or `?n` and `?p`, or `?h` and `?l`, or `?j` and `?k`, or
  `?/` and `??`) mappings to move laterally between cash registers.
- Add argument to `:ResetCashRegisters` command to clear a given cash register.
- Make `:clc` into a function to users can map it how they want.
- Handle global `matchadd`. Everything is mega-broken when you try to use more
  than 1 window : (
- Make sure `:ResetCashRegisters` can finish executing even if it hits an error
  during `matchdelete`. It should be sure to clear the match ID array too.
- Allow the user to customize their `?` key.
- use üí¥, üí∑, and üè¶ in the readme somewhere

## ü™ô Other Tips

Here are some other searching tips that are not part of Cash.nvim's
functionality, but might be useful.

### Add a search term to the current search

When searching in Vim, `\|` is the "or" operator, meaning the pattern
`foo\|bar` will match occurrences of `foo` and occurrences of `bar`. This
mapping allows you to search for something, then press <kbd>+</kbd> to start
searching for something else in addition. It works by starting a new search
that begins with the contents of the old search register plus a `\|` at the
end.

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '+', '/<C-r>/\\|')
```

By default, the <kbd>+</kbd> key in Vim just moves the cursor down 1 line. It
is very similar to <kbd>j</kbd>, so it's not that useful. For this reason,
<kbd>+</kbd> is a good candidate for remapping.

### Center the screen after jumping to a match

This mapping centers the screen after each jump with <kbd>n</kbd>/<kbd>N</kbd>.

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'n', 'nzz')
vim.keymap.set('n', 'N', 'Nzz')
```

This can provide a more consistent experience when paired with Cash.nvim's
`centerAfterSearch` option.
